The Well-Grounded Rubyist
=========================

I'm reading [David A. Black](http://www.wobblini.net/)'s [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black2/).

This repository contains the code I write as I make my way through the book.

I have a bad habit of reading the first ~50 pages of a book and then moving on to something else, so we'll see how this goes. I'll keep this file updated with my progress.

I'm currently on page 46.
